Comparing Original vs. Instrumental to find model-induced lag.
  - Original: .//video//[비챤].wav
  - Instrumental: .//separation_results//[비챤]_Instrumental.wav

--- Step 1: Loading audio files ---
--- Step 2: Calculating lag between files ---

--- Step 3: Results ---
Model-induced lag (Instrumental relative to Original):
  - Lag: 0.0000 samples
  - Lag: 0.000000 seconds

Analysis: The model introduces very little timing distortion.

Total execution time: 10.98 seconds
